# ToS;DR 2
A web app to submit and review points about services for http://tosdr.org. <br/>
Written in JavaScript with help of the meteor framework (https://www.meteor.com). <br/>
Data is saved in a MongoDB. <br/>

## Current state

Highly experimental, incomplete, insecure and not scalable. <br/>
But a great start for 7 working hours :-)


## How to start in development mode

Install meteor:

```shell
curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh
```

Cd into the project root directory (where this README is located) and enter:

```shell
meteor
```

Open [http://localhost:3000] (http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

You need to sign in to see something interesting.
You can sign in/up yourself with the menu in the top right corner.
Email addresses are currently not verified and "Forgot password ?" does not work.
